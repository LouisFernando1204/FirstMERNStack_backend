## Overview

Welcome to my first MERN stack project! This project is an introduction to building full-stack applications using the MERN stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. 

## Project Description

This project demonstrates the use of the MERN stack to build a modern web application. The application consists of:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store data.
- **Express.js**: A Node.js framework used to build the backend server.
- **React**: A JavaScript library used to build the frontend user interface.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime used to run the server-side code.

## Features

- User management: Create, update, and delete users.
- Notes management: Create, update, and delete notes.
- Authentication: Secure user authentication and authorization.
- Responsive design: Built with React to ensure a smooth user experience across devices.
